# Intro: Why I Decide to Install a VM?

Recently with great motion, I decide to install a **Virtual Machine**. As my understanding, it's an OS installed in my own computer and can immitate other OS system. Besides, I asked AI, it says because I like to do something to my computer, so it's more safe to play this on the VM. That's all the reasons.

# How to Install VM?

I chose VB(VirtualBox). Here is the [link](https://www.virtualbox.org/). After download VB from its official website, we also need the OS from Microsoft.(If you choose to install windows on the VB) For example, [Windows11](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/software-download/windows11) can be got from this site. Choose the ISO setup choice. (Actually I do not understand what is iso, but a guide video on [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1v34y1D7Ec?spm_id_from=333.788.player.switch&vd_source=511a91ef2f7b2b1dbc28ac62a47dadae&p=3) told me to do that) Find a folder to store this packages. (VB setup and OS setup)

The next step is to install VB and set it. 

- First, you should click the 「全局设定」(I use cn ver so use cn term) and set the folder that used to store the VM. 
- And find「热键」, it's the key to back from VM. (As I have tried, except for the host key and 「任务管理器」, the other key on the keyboard make no use if you choose a whole screen) 
- cancle the 「更新」
- enter setting
- name th VM
- ditribute the memory and CPU
- in store, choose the disk file (the iso file) for the empty disk
- finally run the VM!

# Set VM

First, you need to install the OS. It will cost some time, so it's good to try a cup of coffee. (It's just a joke. In fact I am writing this document while waiting for the instalation. But 20min has past, and the instalation is still running.)

Now the VM finished the OS install. But now comes a problem that i can not find my mouse. Emmmm, a good treak is restarting.
